# Progressive Web App (PWA) for Private Schools and Training Centers

## Overview

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React that serves as a mobile portal for private schools and training centers. The application provides full Arabic support with RTL (Right-to-Left) layout and includes features for announcements, blog posts, teacher communication, suggestions, and learning groups management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language in English. User prefers English communication over other languages.

## System Architecture

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to access protected routes
2. AuthWrapper checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated, redirects to login
4. Firebase handles authentication
5. User profile fetched from Firestore
6. Role-based permissions applied

### Data Management
- **Client-side**: TanStack Query for caching and synchronization
- **Server-side**: Express routes with Drizzle ORM queries
- **Real-time**: Firebase Firestore for live updates
- **File uploads**: Firebase Storage integration

## External Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Zod validation
- **UI Library**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui components
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Noto Sans Arabic)

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite for development and production builds
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **ESBuild**: Server-side bundling
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Client Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied to PostgreSQL

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with Vite dev server
- **Production**: Express serves static files and API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL
- **Firebase**: Configuration via environment variables

- **Service Worker**: Handles offline functionality
- **Arabic Support**: RTL layout with proper font loading
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface design
- **Push Notifications**: Integrated notification system

### Database Schema
The application now uses a unified PostgreSQL database approach:
- **User management**: PostgreSQL with Firebase Auth for authentication
- **Content data**: Announcements, blog posts, teachers stored in PostgreSQL
- **Application data**: Messages, suggestions, groups, formations stored in PostgreSQL
- **Registration data**: Group and formation registrations stored in PostgreSQL
- **File storage**: Images and assets in Firebase Storage

#### Database Tables:
- `users` - User profiles with phone numbers and roles
- `announcements` - School announcements and news
- `blog_posts` - Blog content with publishing status
- `teachers` - Teacher profiles and availability
- `messages` - Communication between users and teachers
- `suggestions` - User feedback and suggestions
- `groups` - Learning groups and activities
- `formations` - Training courses and programs
- `group_registrations` - Group enrollment data
- `formation_registrations` - Course enrollment data

This unified approach provides better data consistency, easier queries, and improved performance while maintaining the authentication benefits of Firebase.

## User Guide for AdminUsers Page

**The AdminUsers page works correctly** - it shows users filtered by school. To see created users:

### Schools and Their Users:
1. **test school 1** (code: testschool1)
   - 5 users: 1 admin, 2 teachers, 2 students
   - Admin login: `admin.testschool1@example.com` / password: `admin123`
   - This admin can see all 5 users in test school 1

2. **المعهد** (code: Mahad) 
   - 4 users: 1 admin, 3 teachers
   - Admin login: `mou3athe0517@gmail.com` / password: (existing password)
   - This admin can see all 4 users in المعهد school

### Cross-School User Sharing:
✓ **Same email/phone across schools**: Users can now have identical emails and phone numbers across different schools
✓ **School context authentication**: Login uses school context to find the correct user account
✓ **Multi-tenant data isolation**: Each school admin only sees users from their specific school
✓ **Example**: `sameuser@example.com` exists as both student in test school 1 and teacher in المعهد

3. **Users without school assignment** (orphaned users)
   - These won't appear in any school's AdminUsers page
   - Super admin can see system-wide data

### How to Access:
1. Go to your school selection page
2. Choose the specific school 
3. Login as admin for that school
4. Navigate to AdminUsers page
5. You'll see only users from your school (proper multi-tenancy)

**Multi-tenant data isolation is working perfectly** - each school admin only sees their school's users.
