# School Management Desktop App

This directory contains the Electron foundation for the desktop version of the school management PWA.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### Running the Desktop App in Development

1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, start Electron:**
   ```bash
   node run-electron.js
   ```

   Or alternatively, you can run them separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start web server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Wait for web server to start, then run Electron
   npx electron electron/main.js
   ```

### Features Currently Available

#### âœ… Implemented
- Basic Electron wrapper around existing React PWA
- Native desktop menu system (Arabic RTL support)
- Window management and application lifecycle
- Security layer with context isolation
- Development hot reload support
- Platform detection (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Desktop features detection and testing interface

#### ðŸš§ Planned for Implementation
- QR Code scanner integration
- Thermal printer support
- File import/export operations
- Offline database synchronization
- Auto-updater system
- Hardware device management

### File Structure

```
electron/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js          # Main Electron process
â”œâ”€â”€ preload.js       # Security bridge between main and renderer
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/          # Icons and resources
â””â”€â”€ scripts/         # Build and deployment scripts

client/src/hooks/
â””â”€â”€ useElectron.ts   # React hooks for Electron features

client/src/components/
â””â”€â”€ DesktopFeatures.tsx   # Desktop features testing interface
```

### Testing Desktop Features

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Panel â†’ Desktop Features
3. Test available features like QR scanning, printing, and file operations
4. View platform information and feature availability

### Building for Distribution

```bash
# Simple build for current platform
node build-desktop.js

# Build for specific platforms
node build-desktop.js windows    # Windows installers (.exe, .msi)
node build-desktop.js mac        # macOS installer (.dmg)
node build-desktop.js linux      # Linux packages (.AppImage, .deb)
node build-desktop.js all        # All platforms

# Advanced builds
node electron/scripts/build.js    # Full build script
node electron/scripts/package.js # Packaging only
```

**What Gets Built:**
- **Windows**: NSIS installer (.exe), MSI package, portable executable
- **macOS**: Disk image (.dmg), application bundle (.app)
- **Linux**: AppImage (.AppImage), Debian package (.deb), RPM package

**Output Location:** `desktop-dist/` folder

### Next Steps

1. **Hardware Integration**: Add support for USB QR scanners and thermal printers
2. **Financial Module**: Implement accounting and payment processing features
3. **Database Sync**: Add offline-first database with cloud synchronization
4. **Auto-Updates**: Configure automatic updates via GitHub releases
5. **Distribution**: Set up code signing and installation packages

### Development Notes

- The desktop app runs your existing React PWA unchanged
- All current web features work identically in the desktop version
- Desktop-specific features are additive, not replacing existing functionality
- The same codebase serves both web (PWA) and desktop (Electron) versions
