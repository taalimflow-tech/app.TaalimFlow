Expected vs Actual

Expected SELECT:

SELECT group_id, student_id, student_type, school_id 
FROM group_mixed_assignments 
WHERE student_id=26 AND student_type='student' AND school_id=8

Current SELECT (broken):

SELECT ??? -- Missing group_id column
FROM group_mixed_assignments 
WHERE student_id=26 AND student_type='student' AND school_id=8

The WHERE clause is perfect, but the SELECT clause in the getStudentCompleteProfile function isn't retrieving the group_id column that's needed to then fetch the actual group details. That's why you get empty enrolledGroups even though the assignments exist.
